# ColaBed19

Making it easier for web apps to bust social isolation!

Other goals fo ColaBed19:

  * helping people connect during COVID-19 if it's easier for web devs to add video to their apps.
  * crowd source WebRTC bugfixes and testing for the benefit of all.
  
Who are we, by the way? We're an online primary care startup https://cortico.ca, bringing technology to medical clinics who use Oscar EMR in Canada.

  * Easier testing for new clinics, since we could test the video appointment in a demo environment more easily without a full Cortico install and creds
  * Closer alignment with Oscar EMR on open source.
